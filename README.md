**xbcontrol** - XRandr display Brightness and gamma Control

XBControl - a program for adjusting the brightness and gamma of the monitor.

- After installation, it is located in the `Menu-Utilities`
- After the launch, it sits in the tray (yellow brightness icon)
- After a single left - click, the window shown in the screenshot opens. The settings are saved when the settings window is closed. It is possible to put in autoload (the button with the `Rocket` - it will be sunk when pressed; pressing again removes autoload), reset the settings to default, or close the program.

Made and tested in Mageia Linux-7/8 (LXDE, LXQt, MATE, Cinnamon).
